after opening the website it should store a session number starting with 0001-0924 that last 4 digits is the month and day today so if the usr created in other day it should 0001-0925 and so on in other days
it should have a button befor going to the main home screen that the button is Create Bring out Permit approval form"
Allows selecting up to 4 users.
